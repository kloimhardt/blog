Let's take a simple example: you go into a grocery store in Italy. You look where the fridge is and grab a peace of butter. You go to the cashier, pay and leave.

You know the universal rules: butter must be in a fridge, one needs to pay before getting out.

Rules are first of all something you need to understand. You do not necessarily have to know their reasons. You learn and subsequently understand the rules by standing by and watching, maybe your parents or friends etc.

In following the rules you aquire competence to put them to action. Some animals even seem to have competence that is present at birth. In that case they do not even have to understand. I find that hard to believe.

In any case, understanding and competence is an important first step in any endeavour. If you want to achive something, understand the rules and get competent.

One other thing is, if you want to break the rules or write new ones: In that case you need to comprehend the existing rules, you need to know thier reasons.

So I make the distinction between understanding/competence on the one hand and reasoning/comprehension on the other. And want to focus on the first pair.

I think one is in a good place when one encounters a new situation and one is given some simple rules to understand. One can start to do something successful immediately. Which is rewarding.

On the other hand, it is important to not get complacent by this comfortable new situation: the one who does not go with the time, goes -- with time. But we are not that type of person, because be strive for comprehension. So competence it is. Competence before comprehension, ideally competence without the necessity of comprehension.
