And in my    hour of  darkness
Und iss erst rich tig finster

She  is  stan ding  right  in   front of me

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the broken hearted People

living in the world agree

There will be an answer
Let it be

For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Instrumental Break]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 3]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be, yeah


[Outro]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
