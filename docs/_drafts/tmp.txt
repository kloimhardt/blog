Dear Jeaye, following the impulse given by jank, I wrote an interop library to access ROOT from Ferret (remembering my 15 month stay at CERN 25 years ago). I also wrote (with some help) an alpha-version of a scientific article, possibly to be published in some journal to target the right audience. It would be great if you could send me your opinion on all this, especially if an additional section on jank is relevant and interesting to you. Kind regards, Markus
