Dear Jeaye, following the impulse given by jank, I wrote an interop library to access ROOT from Ferret. I was using ROOT some 25 years ago during my 15 month stay at CERN/Geneva. I also wrote (with the help of a friend turned professor) a blog post which is an alpha-version of a scientific article, maybe to be published in a journal (after you co-author a re-write for jank? Is that conceivable?). I figured that to make jank popular with scientists, one has to speak their language. Could you please read the article and send your opinion. Regards, Markus
