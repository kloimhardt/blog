I think Stephen King should be read in the form of verse, see for example „The Stand“, beginning of chapter forty-six:

It was late evening,  
July  
twenty-seven.  
They were camped on what the sign,  
now half-  
demolished by summer storms,  
proclaimed to be  
the Kunkle Fairgrounds.

Kunkle itself,  
Kunkle, Ohio was south of them.  
There had been some sort  
of fire there, and  
most of Kunkle was gone.

Stu said it had  
probably been lightning.  
Harold had 
of course disputed that.

These days if Stu Red-  
man said a firetruck was red, Harold  
Lauder would produce facts  
and figures proving that  
most of them these days  
were green.

She sighed and  
rolled over. Couldn’t sleep.  
She was afraid  
of the dream.

To her left  
the five motorcycles  
stood in a row. Heeled over  
on their kickstands, moonlight twinkling  
along their chromed exhaust pipes  
and fittings. As if

a band of Hells Angels  
had picked this particular spot  
to crash for the night.

Not that the Angels  
ever would have ridden such  
a pussycat bunch of bikes as  
those Hondas  
and Yamahas, she supposed.

They had driven ‚hogs‘ …  
or was that just something she  
had picked up from the old American-  
International bike epics  
she’s seen on TV.

The wild Angles.  
The devil’s Angles.  
Hell’s Angels on Wheels.  
The bike pictures

had been very big  
when she had been in high school,  
Wells Drive-In,  
Sandford Drive-In,  
South-Portland Twin,

you pays your money and  
you takes your choice. Now kaput,

all the drive-ins were kaput, not  
to mention the Hell’s Angles  
and good old American-  
International Pictures.

Put it in your diary,  
Frannie, she  
told herself and rolled over  
on her other side.  
Not tonight. Tonight  
she was going to sleep, dreams,  
or no dreams. twenty paces  
from where she was lying,

she could see the others zonked out  
in their sleeping bags like Hell’s  
Angels after a big beer party, the one   
where everybody in the picture got laid 
except for Peter Fonda and  
Nancy Sinatra. Harold, Stu,  
Glen Bateman, Mark Braddock,  
Perion McCarthy. Take Sominex  
tonight and sleep …

Reclined laterally,  
left, she rests,  
with right and left legs flexed,  
the index finger and  
thumb of the right hand resting  
on the bridge of the nose. She rests,  
she has travelled with Sinbad the Sailor  
and Tinbad the Tailor  
and Jinbad the Jailer  
and Whinbad the Whaler  
and Ninbad the Nailer  
and Finbad the Failer  
and Binbad the Bailer  
and Pinbad the Pailer  
and Minbad the Mailer  
and Hinbad the Hailer  
and Rinbad the Railer  
and Dinbad the Kailer  
and Vinbad the Quailer  
and Linbad the Yailer  
and Xinbad the Phthailer.  
Going to dark dream there was  
a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc’s  
auk’s egg in the night of the bed of  
all the auks of the rocs of  
Darkinbad the Brightdayler.

Okok, I took the last verse from Joyce’s famous end of Ulysses‘ Ithaca chapter, couldn’t resist, sorry.
