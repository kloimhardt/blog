Mr C(lavius) F(rederick) Earbrass is, of  
course, the well-known novelist. Of his books,  
*A Moral Dustbin*, *More Chains Than Clank*,  
*Was it Likely?*, and the Hipdeep trilogy are,  
perhaps, the most admired. Mr Earbrass is  
seen on the croquet lawn of his home,  
Hobbies Odd, near Collapsed Pudding in  
Mortshire. He is studying a game left  
unfinished at the end of summer.

On November 18th of alternate years  
Mr Earbrass begins writing ‘his new novel’.  
Weeks ago he chose its title at random from  
a list of them he keeps in a little green  
note book. It being tea-time of the 17th,  
he is alarmed not to have thought of a plot  
to which *The Unstrung Harp* might apply,  
but his mind will keep reverting to the  
last biscuit on the plate.
