          Mr C(lavius) F(rederick) Earbrass is, of <br>
          course, the well-known novelist. Of his books, <br>
          "A Moral Dustbin", "More Chains Than Clank", <br>
          "Was it Likely?", and the Hipdeep trilogy are, <br>
          perhaps, the most admired. Mr Earbrass is <br>
          seen on the croquet lawn of his home, <br>
          Hobbies Odd, near Collapsed Pudding in <br>
          Mortshire. He is studying a game left <br>
          unfinished at the end of summer. <br>

      <p>On November 18th of alternate years <br>
          Mr Earbrass begins writing ‘his new novel’. <br>
          Weeks ago he chose its title at random from <br>
          a list of them he keeps in a little green <br>
          note book. It being tea-time of the 17th, <br>
          he is alarmed not to have thought of a plot <br>
          to which "The Unstrung Harp" might apply, <br>
          but his mind will keep reverting to the <br>
          last biscuit on the plate. <br>

        Snow was tailing ...<b0>
        Snow was tailing when Mr Earbrass <br>
        woke, which suggested he open Tl r H with <br>
        the first flakes of what could be developed <br>
        into a prolonged and powerfully purple <br>
        blizzard. On paper, if not outdoors, they <br>
        have kept coming down all afternoon, <br>
        over and over again, in all possible ways' ; <br>
        and only now, at nightfall, have done so <br>
        satisfactorily. For writing Mr Earbrass <br>
        affects an athletic sweater of forgotten <br>
        origin and unknown significance ■, it is <br>
        always worn hind-side-to. <b0>
        ... worn hind-side-to. <b0>

        Several weeks later ... <b0>
        Several weeks later, the lootah trickling <br>
        onhis knees, Mr Earbrass mulls over an <br>
        awkward retrospective bit that ought to <br>
        go in Chapter II . But where ? Even the <br>
        voice of the omniscient author can <br>
        hardly afford to interject a seemingly <br>
        pointless anecdote concerning Ladder back <br>
        inTibet when the other characters are <br>
        feverishly engaged m wondering whether <br>
        to have the pond at Disshiver Cottage <br>
        dragged or not. <b0>
        ... dragged or not. <b0>

        Mr Ear brass belongs ... <b0>
        Mr Ear brass belongs to the straying, rather <br>
        than to the sedentary, type of author. He is <br>
        never to be found at his desk unless actually <br>
        writing down a sentence. Before this <br>
        happens he broods over it indefinitely <br>
        while picking up and putting down again <br>
        small, loose objects; walking diagonally <br>
        across rooms ; staring out windows ;and so <br>
        forth. He frequently hums, more in his <br>
        mind than anywhere else, themes from <br>
        the V oddington Te Deum. <b0>
        ... the V oddington Te Deum. <b0>

        It was one of Mr Earbrass’s ...<b0>
        It was one of Mr Earbrass’s better days; he <br>
        wrote for so long and with such intensity that <br>
        when he stopped he felt quite sick . Havi ng <br>
        leaned out a window into a strong wind for <br>
        several minutes, he is now restoring himself <br>
        in the kitchen and rereading TUH as far as he <br>
        has gotten. He cannot help but feel that <br>
        Lirp s return and almost immediate impalement <br>
        on the bottle tree was one of his better ideas. <br>
        The jelly in his sandwich is about to get all <br>
        over his fingers. <b0>
        ... over his fingers. <b0>

        Mr Earbrass has finished ... <b0>
        Mr Earbrass has finished Chapter VII, and <br>
        it is obvious that before plunging ahead <br>
        himself he has got to decide where the plot <br>
        is to go and what will happen to it on <br>
        arrival . He is engaged, in making diagrams <br>
        of possible routes and destinations, and <br>
        wishing he had not dealt so summarily with <br>
        Lirp,who would have been useful for taking <br>
        retributive measures' at the end of Part Three. <br>
        At the moment there is no other character <br>
        capable of them. <b0>
        ... no other character capable of them. <b0>

        Out for a short drive ... <b0>
        Out for a short drive before a supper of <br>
        oysters and trifle, Mr Ear brass stops near <br>
        the abandoned fireworks factory outside <br>
        Something Awful. There is a drowned sort of <br>
        yellow light in the west, and the impression <br>
        of desolation and melancholy is remarkable . <br>
        Air Earbrass jots down & few visual notes <br>
        he suspects may be useful when he reaches <br>
        the point where the action of TUB shifts to <br>
        Hangdog Hall. <b0>
        ... TUB shifts to Hangdog Hall. <b0>

        Mr Earbrass was virtually ...<b0>
        Mr Earbrass was virtually asleep when <br>
        Several lines of verse passed through his <br>
        mind and left it hopelessly awake - Here <br>
        was the perfect epigraph for TUH : <br>
        <br>
        <i> A horrid ? monster has been [something] <br>
        delay ’d <br>
        <br>
        By your/ their indiff ’rence in the dank <br>
        Brown shade <br>
        <br>
        Below the garden. . . <br>
        <br></i>
        His mind’s eye sees them quoted on the <br>
        bottom third ofa right-hand page in a <br>
        (possib1y)olive bound book he read at least <br>
        five years ago. When he does find them, it <br>
        will be a great nuisance if no clue is given <br>
        to their authorship. <b0>
        ... their authorship. <b0>

            Mr Earbrass has driven ...<b0>
            Mr Earbrass has driven over to Nether <br>
            Millstone in search of forced greengages, <br>
            but has been distracted by a bookseller ’s. <br>
            Rummaging among mostly religious tracts <br>
            and pri vately printed reminiscences , he <br>
            has come across The Meaning of the Mouse, <br>
            his second novel . In making sure it has <br>
            not got there by mistake (as he would <br>
            hardly care to pay more for it), he <br>
            discovers it is a presentation copy. For <br>
            Angus— will you ever forget the bloaters? <br>
            Bloaters? Angus? <b0>
            ... Angus?<b0>

            The first draft of TUH ... <b0>
            The first draft of TUH is more than half <br>
            finished , and for some weeks its characters <br>
            have been assuming a fit ful and cloudy' <br>
            reality. Now a minor one named Glassglue <br>
            has materialized at the head of the stairs <br>
            as his creator is about to go down to dinner <br>
            AVr Ear brass was aware of the peculiarly <br>
            unpleasant nubs on his greatcoat, but not the <br>
            blue-tinted spectacles . Glassglue is about to <br>
            mutter something in a tone too low to be <br>
            caught and , stepping sideways, vanish. <b0>
            ... vanish. <b0>

            Mr Earbrass has been ... <b0>
            Mr Earbrass has been rashly skimming <br>
            through the early chapters . which lie has not <br>
            looked at for months, and now sees TUH for <br>
            what it is. Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful . He <br>
            must be mad to go on enduring t he unexguisite <br>
            agony of writing when it all turns out drivel . <br>
            Mad. Why didn’t he become a spy? How does <br>
            one become one? He will burn the MS. Why <br>
            is there no fire? Why aren’t there the <br>
            makings of one? How did he get in the <br>
            unused room on the third floor? <b0>
            ... room on the third floor? <b0>

            Mr Earbrass returned ... <b0>
            Mr Earbrass returned from a walk to find <br>
            a large carton blocking the hall . Alasses of <br>
            brow paper and then t issue have reluctantly <br>
            given up an unnerving silver gilt combination <br>
            epergne and candelabrum. Mr Earbrass <br>
            recollects a letter from a hitherto unknown <br>
            admirer of his work, received the week before; <br>
            it hinted at the early arrival of an offering <br>
            that embodied, in a different but kindred <br>
            form, the same high-souied aspiration that <br>
            animated its recipient’s books . Mr Earbrass <br>
            Can only conclude that the apathy of the <br>
            lower figures is due to their having been <br>
            deprived of novels. <b0>
            ... deprived of novels.<b0>
