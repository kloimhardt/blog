          Mr C(lavius) F(rederick) Earbrass is, of <br>
          course, the well-known novelist. Of his books, <br>
          "A Moral Dustbin", "More Chains Than Clank", <br>
          "Was it Likely?", and the Hipdeep trilogy are, <br>
          perhaps, the most admired. Mr Earbrass is <br>
          seen on the croquet lawn of his home, <br>
          Hobbies Odd, near Collapsed Pudding in <br>
          Mortshire. He is studying a game left <br>
          unfinished at the end of summer. <br>

      <p>On November 18th of alternate years <br>
          Mr Earbrass begins writing ‘his new novel’. <br>
          Weeks ago he chose its title at random from <br>
          a list of them he keeps in a little green <br>
          note book. It being tea-time of the 17th, <br>
          he is alarmed not to have thought of a plot <br>
          to which "The Unstrung Harp" might apply, <br>

        Snow was falling ...<b0>
        Snow was falling when Mr Earbrass <br>
        woke, which suggested he open Tl r H with <br>
        the first flakes of what could be developed <br>
        into a prolonged and powerfully purple <br>
        blizzard. On paper, if not outdoors, they <br>
        have kept coming down all afternoon, <br>
        over and over again, in all possible ways' ; <br>
        and only now, at nightfall, have done so <br>
        satisfactorily. For writing Mr Earbrass <br>
        affects an athletic sweater of forgotten <br>
        origin and unknown significance ■, it is <br>
        always worn hind-side-to. <b0>
        ... worn hind-side-to. <b0>

        Several weeks later ... <b0>
        Several weeks later, the loofah trickling <br>
        on his knees, Mr Earbrass mulls over an <br>
        awkward retrospective bit that ought to <br>
        go in Chapter II . But where ? Even the <br>
        voice of the omniscient author can <br>
        hardly afford to interject a seemingly <br>
        pointless anecdote concerning Ladder back <br>
        inTibet when the other characters are <br>
        feverishly engaged m wondering whether <br>
        to have the pond at Disshiver Cottage <br>
        dragged or not. <b0>
        ... dragged or not. <b0>

        Mr Ear brass belongs ... <b0>
        Mr Ear brass belongs to the straying, rather <br>
        than to the sedentary, type of author. He is <br>
        never to be found at his desk unless actually <br>
        writing down a sentence. Before this <br>
        happens he broods over it indefinitely <br>
        while picking up and putting down again <br>
        small, loose objects; walking diagonally <br>
        across rooms ; staring out windows ;and so <br>
        forth. He frequently hums, more in his <br>
        mind than anywhere else, themes from <br>
        the V oddington Te Deum. <b0>
        ... the <i>Poddington Te Deum.</i> <b0>

        It was one of Mr Earbrass’s ...<b0>
        It was one of Mr Earbrass’s better days; he <br>
        wrote for so long and with such intensity that <br>
        when he stopped he felt quite sick. Having <br>
        leaned out a window into a strong wind for <br>
        several minutes, he is now restoring himself <br>
        in the kitchen and rereading <i>TUH</i> as far as he <br>
        has gotten. He cannot help but feel that <br>
        Lirp's return and almost immediate impalement <br>
        on the bottle tree was one of his better ideas. <br>
        The jelly in his sandwich is about to get all <br>
        over his fingers. <b0>
        ... over his fingers. <b0>

        Mr Earbrass has finished ... <b0>
        Mr Earbrass has finished Chapter VII, and <br>
        it is obvious that before plunging ahead <br>
        himself he has got to decide where the plot <br>
        is to go and what will happen to it on <br>
        arrival. He is engaged, in making diagrams <br>
        of possible routes and destinations, and <br>
        wishing he had not dealt so summarily with <br>
        Lirp, who would have been useful for taking <br>
        retributive measures' at the end of Part Three. <br>
        At the moment there is no other character <br>
        capable of them. <b0>
        ... no other character capable of them. <b0>

        Out for a short drive ... <b0>
        Out for a short drive before a supper of <br>
        oysters and trifle, Mr Ear brass stops near <br>
        the abandoned fireworks factory outside <br>
        Something Awful. There is a drowned sort of <br>
        yellow light in the west, and the impression <br>
        of desolation and melancholy is remarkable . <br>
        Air Earbrass jots down & few visual notes <br>
        he suspects may be useful when he reaches <br>
        the point where the action of TUB shifts to <br>
        Hangdog Hall. <b0>
        ... TUB shifts to Hangdog Hall. <b0>

        Mr Earbrass was virtually ...<b0>
        Mr Earbrass was virtually asleep when <br>
        Several lines of verse passed through his <br>
        mind and left it hopelessly awake - Here <br>
        was the perfect epigraph for TUH : <br>
        <br>
        <i> A horrid ?monster has been [something] <br>
        delay’d <br>
        <br>
        By your/their indiff’rence in the dank <br>
        Brown shade <br>
        <br>
        Below the garden. . . <br>
        <br></i>
        His mind’s eye sees them quoted on the <br>
        bottom third ofa right-hand page in a <br>
        (possibly)olive bound book he read at least <br>
        five years ago. When he does find them, it <br>
        will be a great nuisance if no clue is given <br>
        to their authorship. <b0>
        ... their authorship. <b0>

            Mr Earbrass has driven ...<b0>
            Mr Earbrass has driven over to Nether <br>
            Millstone in search of forced greengages, <br>
            but has been distracted by a bookseller ’s. <br>
            Rummaging among mostly religious tracts <br>
            and privately printed reminiscences , he <br>
            has come across <i>The Meaning of the Mouse,</i> <br>
            his second novel . In making sure it has <br>
            not got there by mistake (as he would <br>
            hardly care to pay more for it), he <br>
            discovers it is a presentation copy. <i>For <br>
            Angus— will you ever forget the bloaters?</i> <br>
            Bloaters? Angus? <b0>
            ... Angus?<b0>

            The first draft of TUH ... <b0>
            The first draft of TUH is more than half <br>
            finished , and for some weeks its characters <br>
            have been assuming a fitful and cloudy <br>
            reality. Now a minor one named Glassglue <br>
            has materialized at the head of the stairs <br>
            as his creator is about to go down to dinner <br>
            Mr Ear brass was aware of the peculiarly <br>
            unpleasant nubs on his greatcoat, but not the <br>
            blue-tinted spectacles. Glassglue is about to <br>
            mutter something in a tone too low to be <br>
            caught and, stepping sideways, vanish. <b0>
            ... vanish. <b0>

            Mr Earbrass has been ... <b0>
            Mr Earbrass has been rashly skimming <br>
            through the early chapters . which lie has not <br>
            looked at for months, and now sees TUH for <br>
            what it is. Dreadful, <i>dreadful</i>, DREADFUL. He <br>
            must be mad to go on enduring t he unexquisite <br>
            agony of writing when it all turns out drivel.<br>
            Mad. Why didn’t he become a spy? How does <br>
            one become one? He will burn the MS. Why <br>
            is there no fire? Why aren’t there the <br>
            makings of one? How did he get in the <br>
            unused room on the third floor? <b0>
            ... room on the third floor? <b0>

            Mr Earbrass returned ... <b0>
            Mr Earbrass returned from a walk to find <br>
            a large carton blocking the hall. Masses of <br>
            brow paper and then t issue have reluctantly <br>
            given up an unnerving silver gilt combination <br>
            epergne and candelabrum. Mr Earbrass <br>
            recollects a letter from a hitherto unknown <br>
            admirer of his work, received the week before; <br>
            it hinted at the early arrival of an offering <br>
            that embodied, in a different but kindred <br>
            form, the same high-souled aspiration that <br>
            animated its recipient’s books . Mr Earbrass <br>
            Can only conclude that the apathy of the <br>
            lower figures is due to their having been <br>
            deprived of novels. <b0>
            ... deprived of novels.<b0>

            Even more harrowing ...<b0>
            Even more harrowing than the first chapters <br>
            of a novel are the las t , for Mr Earbrass anyway. <br>
            The characters have one and all become <br>
            thoroughly tiresome, as though he had been <br>
            trapped at the same party with them since <br>
            the day before; neglected sections o t the plot <br>
            loom on every hand, waiting to be disposed o { ; <br>
            his verbs seem to have withered away and <br>
            his adjectives to be proliferating past control. <br>
            Furthermore, at this stage he inevitably gets <br>
            insomnia. Even rereading <i>The Truffle Plantation</i> <br>
            (his first novel) does not induce sleep. In the <br>
            blue horror of dawn the vines in the carpet <br>
            appear likely to begin twining up his ankles. <b0>
            ... twining up his ankles.<b0>

            Though <i>TUH</i> is within ...<b0>
            Though <i>TUH</i> is within less than a chapter <br>
            of completion, Mr Earbrass has felt it his <br>
            cultural and civic duty, and a source of <br>
            possible edification, tout tend a performance <br>
            at Lying-in-the-Way of Prawne’s <i>The Nephew's <br>
            Tragedy.</i> It is being put on, for the first <br>
            time since the early seventeenth century, <br>
            by the West Mortshire Impassioned Amateurs <br>
            of Melpomene. Unfortunately, Mr Earbrass <br>
            is unable to take m even one of its five <br>
            plots because he cannot get those few <br>
            unwritten pages out of his mind. <b0>
            ... out of his mind.<b0>

            In that brief moment ... <b0>
            In that brief moment between day and <br>
            night when everything seems to have stopped <br>
            forgoodandall, Mr Earbrass has written the <br>
            last sentence of <i>TUH</i>. The room’s appearance <br>
            of tidiness and Mr Earbrass's of calm are <br>
            alike deceptive. The MS is stuffed all <br>
            anyhow in the lower right hand drawer of <br>
            the desk and Mr Earbrasshimself is wildly <br>
            distrait. His feet went to sleep some time ago, <br>
            there is a dull throbbing behind his left ear, <br>
            and his moustache feels as uncomfortable as if <br>
            it were false, or belonged to someone else. <b0>
            ... belonged to someone else. <b0>

            The next day ... <b0>
            The next day Mr Ear brass is conscious but <br>
            very little more. He wanders through the house, <br>
            leaving doors open and empty tea cups on the <br>
            floor. From time to time the thought occurs <br>
            to him that he really ought to go and dress, <br>
            and he gets up several minutes later, only to <br>
            sit down again in the first chair he comes <br>
            to. The better part of a week will have elapsed <br>
            before he has recovered enough to do anything <br>
            more helpful. <b0>
            ... more helpful. <b0>

            Some weeks later ... <b0>
            Some weeks later, with pen, ink, scissors, <br>
            paste, a decanter of sherry', and a vast <br>
            reluctance, Mr Earbrass begins to revise TUH. <br>
            This means, first, transposing passages, <br>
            or reversing the order of their paragraphs, or <br>
            crumpling them up furiously and throwing <br>
            them in the waste-basket. After that there <br>
            is rewriting. This is worse than merely <br>
            writing, because not only does he have to <br>
            think cup new things just the same, but at <br>
            the same time try not to remember the old <br>
            ones. Before Mr Earbrass is through , at <br>
            least one third of TUH will bear no <br>
            resemblance to its original state. <b0>
            ... its original state. <b0>

            Mr Earbrass sits ... <b0>
            Mr Earbrass sits on the opposite side of the <br>
            study from his desk, gathering courage for <br>
            the worst part of all in the undertaking of a <br>
            novel, i.e., making a clean copy of the final <br>
            version of the MS . l\lot only is it repulsive to <br>
            the eye and hand, with its tattered edges. stains, <br>
            rumpled patches, scratchings-out, and scribbling. <br>
            but its contents are, by this time, boring to <br>
            the point of madness. A freshly-filled inkwell, <br>
            new pheasant-feather pens, and two reams of <br>
            the most expensive cream laid paper are <br>
            negligible inducements for embarking on <br>
            such a loathsome proceeding. <b0>
            ... loathsome proceeding. <b0>

            Holding <i>TUH</i> ... <b0>
            Holding <i>TUH</i> not very neatly done up in <br>
            pink butcher’s paper, which was all he could <br>
            find in a last-minute search before leaving <br>
            to catch his train for London, Mr Earbrass <br>
            arrives at the offices of his publishers to <br>
            deliver it. The stairs look oddly menacing, <br>
            as though he might break a leg on one of them. <br>
            Suddenly the whole thing strikes him as very <br>
            Silly, and he thinks he will go and drop his <br>
            parcel off the Embankment and thus save <br>
            everyone concerned a good deal of fuss. <b0>
            ... a good deal of fuss. <b0>

            Mr Earbrass escaped ... <b0>
            Mr Earbrass escaped from Messrs Scuffle <br>
            and Dustcough, who were most anxious to go <br>
            into all the ramifications of a scheme for <br>
            having his novels translated into Urdu, and <br>
            went to call on a distant cousin. The latter <br>
            was planning to do the antique shops this <br>
            afternoon,So Mr Earbrass agreed to join him. <br>
            In the eighteenth shop they have visited, <br>
            the cousin thinks he sees a rare sort of <br>
            lustre jug, and Mr Earbrass irritatedly <br>
            wonders why anyone should have had a <br>
            fantod staffed and put under a glass bell. <b0>
            ... put under a glass bell. <b0>

            The night before <b0>
            The night before returning home to <br>
            Mortshire Mr Earbrass allows himself to he <br>
            taken to a literary dinner in a private dining <br>
            room of Le Trottoir Imbecile . Among his fellow- <br>
            authors, few of whom he recognizes and none <br>
            of whom he knows, are Lawk, Sangwidge, <br>
            Ha’p’orth, Avuncular, and Lord Legbail. The <br>
            unwell-looking gentleman wrapped in a <br>
            greatcoat is an obscure essayist named <br>
            Frowst. The talk deals with disappointing <br>
            sales, inadequate publicity , worse than <br>
            inadequate royalties, idiotic or criminal <br>
            reviews, others’ declining talent, and the <br>
            unspeakable horror of the literary life. <b0>
            the literary life. <b0>

            <i>TUH</i> is over ... <b0>
            <i>TUH</i> is over so to speak, but far from done <br>
            with. The galleys have arrived, and Mr <br>
            Earbrass goes over them with mingled <br>
            excitement and disgust. It all looks so <br>
            different set up in type that at first he <br>
            thought they had sent him the wrong ones <br>
            by mistake. He is quite giddy from trying <br>
            to physically control the sheets and at <br>
            the same time keep the amount of <br>
            absolutely necessary changes within the <br>
            allowed pecuniary limits. <b0>
            ... pecuniary limits. <b0>

            Mr Earbrass has received ... <b0>
            Mr Earbrass has received the sketch for the <br>
            dust-wrapper of <i>TUH</i>. Even after staring at <br>
            it continuously for twenty minutes, he <br>
            really cannot believe it. Whatever were <br>
            they thinking of? That drawing. Those <br>
            colours. <i>Ugh.</i> On any book it would be <br>
            ugly, vulgar, and illegible . On his book it <br>
            Would be these, and also disastrously <br>
            wrong. Mr Earbrass looks forward to an <br>
            exhilarating hour of conveying these <br>
            sentiments to Scuffle and Dustcough. <b0>
            ... Scuffle and Dustcough. <b0>

            Things contined ... <b0>
            Things contined to come, this time Mr <br>
            Earbrass’s six free copies of <i>TUH</i>. There are, <br>
            alas, at least three times that number of <br>
            people who expect to receive one of t hem. <br>
            Buying the requisite number of additional <br>
            copies does not happen to be the solution, as it <br>
            would come out almost at once , and everyone <br>
            would be very angry at his wanton distribution <br>
            of them to just anyone, and write him little <br>
            notes of thanks ending with the remark that <br>
            TUH seems rather down from your usual level <br>
            of polish but then you were probably in a <br>
            hurry for the money. If it didn’t come out, <br>
            the list would be three times larger for <br>
            his next book. <b0>
            ... his next book. <b0>

            To day <i>TUH</i> is published ... <b0>
            To day <i>TUH</i> is published , and Air Ear bras S <br>
            has come into Nether Millstone to do some <br>
            errands which could not be put off any longer. <br>
            He has been uncharacteristically thorough <br>
            about doing them, and it is late afternoon <br>
            before he pauses in front of a bookseller’s <br>
            window on the way back to his car. Having <br>
            made certain, out of the corner of his eye, <br>
            a copy of <i>TUH</i> was in it, he is carefully <br>
            reading the title of every other book there <br>
            in a state of extreme and pointless embarrassment. <b0>
            ... and pointless embarrassment. <b0>

            Scuffle and Dustcough have ... <b0>
            Scuffle and Dustcough have thoughtfully, <br>
            if gratuitously, sent all the papers with <br>
            reviews in them. They make a gratifyingly <br>
            large heap. Mr Earbrass refuses to be <br>
            intimidated into rushing through them, but <br>
            he is having a certain amount of difficulty in <br>
            concentrating on, or, rather, making any sense <br>
            whatever out oh, <i>A Compendium of the Minor <br>
            Heresies of the Twelfth Century in Asia Minor.</i> <br>
            He has been meaning to finish it ever <br>
            since he began if two years and seven <br>
            months before, at which time he bogged <br>
            down on page 33. <b0>
            ... on page 33. <b0>

            At an afternoon ... <b0>
            At an afternoon forgathering at the <br>
            Vicarage vaguely in Mr Ear brass’s honor, <br>
            where he has been busy handing round cups <br>
            of tea, he is brought up short by Col Knout, <br>
            M.F.H. of the Blathering Hunt. He demands <br>
            to know just what Mr Earbrass was ‘getting <br>
            at’ in the last scene of Chapter XIV. Mr <br>
            Earbrass is afraid he doesn’t know what <br>
            the Colonel is. Is what? Getting at himself. <br>
            The Colonel snorts, Mr Earbrass sighs. <br>
            This encounter, which will go on for some <br>
            time and get nowhere, will leave Mr <br>
            Earbrass feeling very weak indeed. <b0>
            ... very weak indeed. <b0>

            Mr Earbrass stands ... <b0>
            Mr Earbrass stands on the terrace at <br>
            twilight. It is bleak, it is cold; and the <br>
            virtue has gone out of everything. Words <br>
            drift through his mind: <i>anguish turnips <br>
            conjunctions illness defeat string <br>
            parties no parties urns desuetude <br>
            disaffection claws loss Trebizond <br>
            napkins shame stones distance fever <br>
            Antipodes mush glaciers incoherence <br>
            labels miasma amputation tides <br>
            deceit mourning elsewards ...</i> <b0>
            ... mourning elsewards. <b0>

            Before he knew ... <b0>
            Before he knew what he was doing, Mr <br>
            Earbrass found he had every intention of <br>
            spending a few weeks on the Continent. In <br>
            a trance of efficiency, which could have <br>
            surprised no one more than himself, he <br>
            made the complicated and maddening <br>
            preparations for his departure in no time <br>
            at all. Now, at dawn, he stands, quite numb <br>
            with cold and trepidation , looking at the <br>
            churning surface of the Channel. He <br>
            assumes he will be horribly sick for hours and <br>
            hours, but it doesn’t matter. Though he is a <br>
            person to whom things do not happen, <br>
            perhaps they may when he is on the other side. <b0>
            ... he is on the other side.
