          Mr C(lavius) F(rederick) Earbrass is, of <br>
          course, the well-known novelist. Of his books, <br>
          "A Moral Dustbin", "More Chains Than Clank", <br>
          "Was it Likely?", and the Hipdeep trilogy are, <br>
          perhaps, the most admired. Mr Earbrass is <br>
          seen on the croquet lawn of his home, <br>
          Hobbies Odd, near Collapsed Pudding in <br>
          Mortshire. He is studying a game left <br>
          unfinished at the end of summer. <br>

      <p>On November 18th of alternate years <br>
          Mr Earbrass begins writing ‘his new novel’. <br>
          Weeks ago he chose its title at random from <br>
          a list of them he keeps in a little green <br>
          note book. It being tea-time of the 17th, <br>
          he is alarmed not to have thought of a plot <br>
          to which "The Unstrung Harp" might apply, <br>
          but his mind will keep reverting to the <br>
          last biscuit on the plate. <br>

        Snow was tailing ...<b0>
        Snow was tailing when Mr Earbrass <br>
        woke, which suggested he open Tl r H with <br>
        the first flakes of what could be developed <br>
        into a prolonged and powerfully purple <br>
        blizzard. On paper, if not outdoors, they <br>
        have kept coming down all afternoon, <br>
        over and over again, in all possible ways' ; <br>
        and only now, at nightfall, have done so <br>
        satisfactorily. For writing Mr Earbrass <br>
        affects an athletic sweater of forgotten <br>
        origin and unknown significance ■, it is <br>
        always worn hind-side-to. <b0>
        ... worn hind-side-to. <b0>

        Several weeks later ... <b0>
        Several weeks later, the lootah trickling <br>
        onhis knees, Mr Earbrass mulls over an <br>
        awkward retrospective bit that ought to <br>
        go in Chapter II . But where ? Even the <br>
        voice of the omniscient author can <br>
        hardly afford to interject a seemingly <br>
        pointless anecdote concerning Ladder back <br>
        inTibet when the other characters are <br>
        feverishly engaged m wondering whether <br>
        to have the pond at Disshiver Cottage <br>
        dragged or not. <b0>
        ... dragged or not. <b0>

        Mr Ear brass belongs ... <b0>
        Mr Ear brass belongs to the straying, rather <br>
        than to the sedentary, type of author. He is <br>
        never to be found at his desk unless actually <br>
        writing down a sentence. Before this <br>
        happens he broods over it indefinitely <br>
        while picking up and putting down again <br>
        small, loose objects; walking diagonally <br>
        across rooms ; staring out windows ;and so <br>
        forth. He frequently hums, more in his <br>
        mind than anywhere else, themes from <br>
        the V oddington Te Deum. <b0>
        ... the V oddington Te Deum.
