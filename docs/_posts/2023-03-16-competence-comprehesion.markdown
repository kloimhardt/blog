Let's take a simple example: you go into a grocery store in Italy. You look where the fridge is and grab a piece of butter. You go to the cashier, pay and leave.

You know the universal rules: butter must be in a fridge, one needs to pay before getting out.

Rules are first of all something you need to understand. You do not necessarily have to know their reasons. You learn and subsequently understand the rules by standing by and watching, maybe your parents or friends etc.

In following the rules you acquire competence to put them to action. Some animals even seem to have competence that is present at birth. In that case they do not even have to understand. I find that hard to believe.

In any case, understanding and competence is an important first step in any endeavour. If you want to achieve something, understand the rules and get competent.

One other thing is if you want to break the rules or write new ones: in that case you need to comprehend the existing rules, you need to know their reasons.

So I make the distinction between understanding/competence on the one hand and reasoning/comprehension on the other.

I have this from Immanuel Kant, he made his most important distinction between wits and reason. Wits is to understand the rules to deal with stuff, reason is to comprehend the principles behind those rules -- so he learns us. His main point is that pure reasoning can easily lead us astray. Hence "Critique of Pure Reason".

And indeed, religious practice seldom does harm, religious principles can do so much more. In the same vain, the rules for estimating the necessary energy to speed up a train have been the same for 200 years, but the principles had to change from Newtonian to relativistic Einstein reasoning.

I think one is in a good place when one encounters a new situation and one is given some simple rules to understand. One can start to do something successful immediately. Best practice is rewarding.

On the other hand, it is important to not get complacent by a comfortable situation: the one who does not go with the time, goes -- with time. After all, the rules for estimating the bang of colliding protons were not known 200 years ago (that went via principled reasoning). But we are not that type of complacent person, because we strive for comprehension, right?

So, being thus not afraid of best practice as a convenient first step, competence it is. We want ways to learn by first understanding without the burdon of arduous reasoning. That is hard enough already in itself. Let that be the slogan of our preferred way of learning: "First the rules, then the principles: Competence before Comprehension".
