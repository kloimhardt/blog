At the end of '23, I wrote a post in CERN's Root forum [1]. The aim was to replace Python as a scripting language. CERN is of course the world's largest particle accelerator. The post got some attention (some 500+ clicks as of today), but no direct feedback was given. I was hoping for feedback, because at least in the US they have an initiative called IRIS-Hep [2] which is dedicated to innovate the data processing of high energy physics.

But clicks without feedback is just as well, the US is big and I am small fry. What really saddens me is the fact that Europe, with CERN hosted in Geneva, plays no part whatsoever in this important IRIS-Hep initiative. We badly need some counterweight to Silicon Valley and European based CERN is one readily available opportunity in that endeavour.

Concerning the specific content of my proposal, the what and the how is laid down in an arXiv article [3] I wrote together with a, dare I say, old friend of mine. ArXiv, although being a pre-print server, would not have accepted the thing without the sprinkle of his star-professorship-dust. They still have some kind of review process there after all.

We also tried to publish the paper in a US journal called "Computing in Science & Engineering", but did not make it there. We got some positive feedback, however. As they were interested in a specific aspect of the "how", they proposed we work more on that (the so called interop part). They were not interested in the overall "what" (= Python replacement) of the paper, though, so I was not motivated for this, the pond was too vast. I guess I am also just a good old European here.

Since then, I improved on another aspect of the "how": I advocate for YAMLScript [4] as the preferred choice for notation of scientific ideas. But that is only noted here and there [5], because although that path is, I think, a possible good direction in the quest to replace Python, I also realise that people have other issues to grapple with.

Maybe one question remains: why CERN? Well, I was there in the '90s [6] with the help of another old friend, that's why.
