At the end of '23, I wrote a post in CERN's Root forum [1]. The aim was to replace Python as a scripting language. CERN is of course the world's largest particle accelerator. The post got some attention (some 500+ clicks as of today), but no direct feedback was given. That is a bit sad, as in the US they have an initiative called IRIS-Hep [2] which is dedicated to innovate the data processing of high energy physics. And sure they closely watch that forum dedicated to their central piece of software. All the more sad is the fact that Europe, its Geneva hosting CERN, plays no part whatsoever in that initiative.

The whole argument of the what and the how is laid down in an arXiv article [3] I wrote together with a, dare I say, old friend of mine. ArXiv, although being a pre-print server, would not have accepted the thing without the sprinkle of his star-professorship-dust. They still have some kind of review process there after all.

We also tried to publish the paper in a journal called "Computing in Science & Engineering", but did not make it there. We got some positive feedback, however. As they were interested in a specific aspect of the "how", they proposed we work more on that (the so called interop part). They were not interested in the overall "what" (= Python replacement) of the paper, though, so I was not motivated for this.

Since then, I improved on another aspect of the "how": I advocate for YAMLScript as the preferred choice for notation of scientific ideas. But that is only noted here and there [4], because although that path is, I think, a possible good direction in the quest to replace Python, I also realise that people have other issues to grapple with.

Maybe one question remains: why CERN? Well, I was there in the '90s [5] with the help of another old friend, that's why.
