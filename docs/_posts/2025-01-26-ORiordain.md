[Aodhán Ó Ríordáin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aodhán_Ó_Ríordáin) has been a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Ireland for the Dublin constituency since July 2024. Speech transcript [(youtube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEPE1o_i4mQ):

Yesterday, we witnessed the inauguration of a man whose ideology embodies everything the EU was founded to reject.
The EU cannot just stand for our values when it is easy. It matters most when it comes at a cost.
And standing up to Trump will come with a cost, but it is much less than the cost of letting this poison win.
And I am done with the niceties from EU leaders to Trump, while his tech bro buddies call for our laws to be
undermined. I am done with the Taoiseach [Prime Minister] of Ireland, with our historic understanding of immigration oppression,
promoting [Trump's golf links](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/422df-statement-by-taoiseach-simon-harris-on-the-inauguration-of-president-trump/)
in [county Clare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Clare) in response to his inauguration.
And I am done with the so-called strong men, who - if they had to live for one day in the shoes of an immigrant,
a woman, or a transgender person - would quiver with fear. Anyone who believes in the founding
principles of the EU should be appalled by what we witnessed yesterday [Musk's straight-arm gesture, the Roman Salute].
I am appalled. So I resist. And Europe must resist, because our history demands it.
