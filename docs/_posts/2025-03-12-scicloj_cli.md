## Preface: the aim of SciCloj
The SciCloj community puts a lot of effort into being inclusive and making the [SciCloj](https://scicloj.github.io) website talk to the target audience -- anybody who has some data to explore.

The following post does not talk to SciCloj's target audience. But rather it tries to talk about its target audience. This poses the first problem: the author puts himself in a meta position which yours truly is not entitled to. The second problem is that the SciCloj audience is so multifaceted that I found it impossible to talk about it in the first place.

I solve both problems with one trick: I talk about a blank slate called SciKloj. It has no target audience yet. Since SciKloj is my fictional invention, I am now entitled to assume that this SciKloj is not yet established within the Clojure community either.

I'll now start my trickery that depends on your, the readers, suspension of disbelieve. But this makes me think: who would be the reader of the following essay? Here I assume my reader to be, like me, an early adopter of SciKloj who intends to present SciKloj to some curious outside audience.

## An essay Ã  clef

### SciKloj caters for a subset of beginners
The message of SciKloj is: "Clojure is the best and most natural language for science and to this aim, the SciKloj community provides Noj as a  framework for data science in Clojure."

The target audience for Noj are data analysts. That means we deal with people who are most probably beginners with Clojure. But we can assume that they are highly trained in logical inference. Beginners, yes, rookies, no. This makes Noj users a special bunch to cater for.

Data analysts will eventually understand that Clojure is best. Because in their role as logicians they will appreciate that Clojure is a functional language. In Clojure, programs have minimum side-effects. As opposed to imperative languages, Clojure programs are like mathematical formulas. That Clojure is mathy poses the main reason to use Clojure in science.

### Make SciKloj visible among Clojurians
Most Clojurians are software developers, working on REST, say. To the typical Clojurian, what SciKloj does is alien. Because we are aliens, we are not exactly invisible but also not seen in the best possible light within the Clojure community. My goal here is to make SciKloj visible in a new light.

For this, I'd like to draw the attention to Python, the most popular language out there. My argument is that if we can draw some of the many Python users to Clojure, Clojurians will notice.

Informed by this argument, I make the following proposal: in order to become more visible within the Clojure community, SciKloj should mainly cater for Python scientists.

There is a related view which I am opposed to: Let's evangelise Lisp, preach S-expressions to scientists. The reason I am opposed to this approach is that in employing such a lispy talk, SciKloj would not add any value. Lots of Lisp people, software developers, already talk about the superiority of S-expressions. They do a great job, SciKloj cannot add anything here but reference those great Lisp figures. And it is not a good strategy to talk about the greatness of Lisp when wanting to become visible among Lispers. They know that already.

My proposal for becoming visible is to become good at one thing: hammering through the message "Clojure is a functional language on the JVM". Please notice that the JVM is central. Fact is that the Java machine is stronger than the Python VM, the JVM is meant for science. While this JVM argument is very important, it is so simple that I cannot say anything more than repeat that the JVM is central to SciKloj.

Over time, Clojurians will realise that for delivering the message "Clojure is functional", SciKloj is the perfect use-case. We need to show to Clojurians how to use SciKloj not to do science but as the way to isolate and present the functional part of Clojure.

So the idea is to become visible within Clojure by successfully introducing SciKloj to Pythonists. And here I humbly put forward that, in order to present Noj, we should dispense with the IDE. That is because the IDE's bells and whistles draw attention away from the simplicity of the Clojure syntax. The IDE does not serve the message of SciKloj, which is: "Clojure is functional". The argument is that when talking to beginners, an unknown IDE draws away attention form the functional design of Clojure.

Taking this proposal to its end means to present Noj with Notepad++. This no-IDE approach is abominable to Clojurians. The following thoughts try to put further weight behind Notepad++, not for general Clojure developers, but only for the narrow field of presenting "science without Python", for presenting SciKloj.

### SciKloj without the IDE
All software developers use integrated IDEs, and that day to day. Scientists, on the other hand are not software developers, they are spaghetti-coders. They spend weeks in their labs gathering data. After they reappear from the basement, their brains are completely reset. Muscle memory from day to day usage of an IDE? Nada. Remembering keystrokes? Nope.

Seasoned Clojure developers will not give the IDE away. Quote:

> My take on this is that tooling is much more important on Clojure (and Lisps in general) than say on Python, specially because of interactive programming and s-expressions which is a big part of its super power. So I would be careful when removing tooling to appeal to beginners in the same way I wouldn't write imperative code in Clojure so it is easier for Python data scientists to get.

So should the Clojure Community provide tooling, provide IDEs for scientists? By all means. And the community already does via Slack channels and youtube videos. The problem really is that scientists are not in those channels, nor do they have the time to be there. They are certainly not the chat guys. They need a written user's guide to follow, and nothing else (please).

So should SciKloj provide more videos and manuals for IDE usage? My answer is: certainly not.
The reason is: time. While it is easy to refer to existing content of the wider community, it takes a lot of effort to produce new videos and manuals. Time spent on presenting IDEs is not well spent, because scientists do not want to spend the time to learn an IDE anyway. It does not improve their self-efficacy enough. This is why Python is so successful, it does not need an IDE.

So my suggestion is to accept that Clojure has a disadvantage over Python in that Python is easy to use in Notepad++. But instead of trying to coerce scientists into the IDEs of general software engineering, I suggest to choose the Figwheel way described below for conveying the single one argument that I think holds currency for scientists: "Clojure is mathy, Clojure is functional".

### The two ways of Clojure
That Notepad++ is viable for Noj at all is because Noj/Clay supports a live reload feature via the CLI. Here, it needs to be clearly recognised that the live-reload feature of Noj/Clay is in full Clojure tradition, i.e. that of Figwheel/shadow-cljs.

What is this tradition? It is that Bruce Hauman, the inventor of Figwheel, started to put the file as the primitive notion of Clojure-coding. This is opposed to the usual way of Clojure, which puts not the "file" but the "namespace" front and center. But Bruce says: "When we have a workflow where our files are being watched ... as we work on them, we have an opportunity to detect syntax/compile errors earlier".

So switching to a file perspective is not only a makeshift. Next to putting the spotlight on Clojure's simplicity, it also has the potential of tackling the problem of error messages. This old Clojure topic will certainly become more pronounced for Pythonists and is a highly fruitful place for SciKloj to tackle. More on that further below.

As opposed to that file-tradition, the original Clojure tradition has been to navigate namespaces with the REPL. The file turns into the background - with the REPL, what is on disk in not what is in memory. While, from the beginning on, Clay was designed with the REPL in mind, my argument is that SciKloj should put the file front and center.

Within this file-tradition, the REPL turns into the background.  [Thomas Heller](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2024/10/18/fullstack-cljs-workflow-with-shadow-cljs.html): "I personally only switch to the CLJS REPL occasionally, since most of the time hot-reload is enough." [Bruce Hauman](https://figwheel.org/docs/hot_reloading.html) was keen not to "take your focus out of the file you are editing."

### What is on disk is in memory
Although not being the standard in Clojure, with libraries like `cljs-reload`, one can always make sure that what it on disk is what is in memory. In communication to the wider Clojure community, this requirement memory=disk can be labeled the "Figwheel-reload" approach. In talking to Python people, it does not need a name, memory=disk is the normal situation.

Now some Clojurians will say: "I would never work like this". Other Clojurians on the other hand would not say that in this strong form, because they use IntelliJ with the "sync the file" feature. In any case, all Clojurians will agree that Figwheel-reload has a certain tradition within Clojure, whether a particular person lives within this tradition or not.

"But you are giving away the superpower of Lisp!", I hear. My answer is: The role of SciKloj cannot be to evangelise the REPL because this is done enough by other great Lisp figures. Moreover, SciKloj should never speak of "superpower" because amongst scientists anyone who speaks of magic will meet condemnation. Rather, while not every Lisp is functional, the role of SciKloj is to hammer through  the fact that "Clojure is functional".

### Error Messages
Improving the error messages of Clojure is a prominent topic in every user survey. I am not sure how serious the survey participants are when they chip in this topic. Because when discussed in chats and forums, this topic is riddled with ambiguity.

On the one hand there are voices who say "I want the whole stacktrace as it is" (probably being happy with their IDE middleware formatting those stacktraces). On the other hand there is the opinion "you do not need error messages", because learning REPL driven development meant starting to think in a kind of Sherlock Holmes way which would supposedly be impaired by focusing on error messages.

In one sense or another, there have been attempts to improve error messages. Figwheel, with its focus on the file, was pioneering the "heads up" display. Another interesting project is "Babel" form Uni Minnesota, because it connects this "error message" topic back to academia, fitting SciKloj perfectly. Also "maria.cloud" has its innovative approach and there is "virhe" by Metosin.

No effort has gained wider traction. This opens a possible role for SciKloj, a role that has been hinted at in the most recent [Clj-together survey](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/call-for-proposals.-feb.-2025-member-survey/): "consensus as to how to create âquickstartâ applications for various usecases ... Otherwise, we risk fragmenting the efforts ... more usable error messages".

With its narrow use-case and a file-based Figwheel-reload approach, SciKloj could tailor customize linters like clj-kondo. This linting will mellow the problem of unbalanced parentheses. It will not go away and will always be a problem for beginners and a disadvantage over Python. Within SciKloj, I argue this to accept and trust that users will eventually master slurping and barfing within an IDE later on.

Clay's browser window offers lots of space for additional linting information, e.g. statically inferred types. Also a sophisticated debugger like Flowstorm could be part of the Clay experience.

### Printline debugging
Despite all sorts of sophisticated debugging tools, the hallmark of the file-based approach is printline debugging. For this, S-expressions are cumbersome. But Clojure since long has a solution: reader conditionals. I call this the "double-comma" solution to printline debugging. Bypassing S-expressions for printline debugging with the double-comma approach is a great idea.

Sometimes "slow calculations" are held against executing whole files. I think the chances of creating something slow are greatly overestimated and one can always store away pre-calculated data.

If a new user experiences slow execution, the first advice should be to use a temporary data-file. In case of further problems, a minimal use-case isolates a possible bug in Clay. In case the problem persists, as SciKloj (next to Clay) also provides a Jupyter kernel, it is best for the user to switch to Jupyter notebooks. In a last step, learning to configure an IDE is certainly valuable, but more on that below.

At this point, I'd rather like to warn against a certain kind of REPL-ish concept that must never be introduced within Clay and the Figwheel-reload approach.

This is the concept of earmarking some part of the code as "special", so that only this part of the code is evaluated when the full source file is read and processed. I call this the "triple-comma fallacy", which is a monstrosity.

That monstrosity is outright harmful to SciKloj. Because any teacher coming from Python, maybe even a professor, sees this approach in some obscure video and finds it valuable. And then, as any user of the proper REPL method knows, he will make a complete mess. And then he remembers that he likes Python better anyway and demonstrates this monstrosity as an argument against Clojure. And then the wider Clojure community will rightly shake their heads and say: "we condemn those SciKloj boffins, we never understood those aliens and their crazy ideas anyway". SciKloj must stick to Clojure tradition to become visible within the Clojure community.

### Against the REPL
For Clay, the REPL is not needed because of its file reload capabilities. There are many advocates of REPL driven development for good reasons. Here, I present three reasons why I think it makes sense to avoid the REPL in a first step:

1) The man reason for using Clojure in science is because it is a functional language on the JVM. Usually, the REPL and functional programming are mentioned in the same breath. Noting could be more wrong. Functional programming is about immutable data. A pure function does not change the data it is given to, it calculates new data. Functional programming is mathy. REPL driven development, on the contrary, is based on mutation of code and data, which is exactly the opposite of demonstrating immutability. For this reason, the REPL is confusing for anyone trying to understand Clojure.

2) The REPL has its own learning curve. The replacing or adding of code in a running program, because of being mutation, needs advanced knowledge and care. One can easily get to a state where what's in memory does not match up to what's on disk. As a result, a perfectly well functioning program can refuse to work after restart. A frustration to be avoided in a first step.

3) The REPL is in development practice not used without a properly configured development environment. As said in this influential [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx0-pViyIDU&feature=youtu.be&t=740) on the topic: "you work in your favourite tool", i.e. IntelliJ, Calva, Chlorine or Cider. This last tool is presented [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDrpclY54E0), which demonstrates that one has to prepare a few things before using the REPL in its intended way.

Now that I argued that one should avoid the REPL in a first step, I continue to describe how to introduce this important concept in the SciKloj context.

### The REPL prompt
In order to introduce the REPL concept (after having presented Noj using the Figwheel-reload approach), it is best to show Noj in a Jupyter notebook. That means to dispense with Clay for introducing the REPL. This might be a tough step but it serves the purpose of using an already established tradition for introducing the notion of the REPL.

Nonetheless, a Lisper will never leave the podium without having presented his own concept of the REPL. And there, the urge is to show his cherished workflow based on his preferred IDE connected to the REPL. He wants to show his superpower. This is a good thing.

When introducing the REPL, I argue that SciKloj's core task is to refer to already existing videos and blogs of the wider Clojure community.

Also, encourage the wider Clojure community to watch Clay videos. Of course within the Clay window we have nicely formatted, code-highlighted, colour and all, line numbers, indentation, linted code with wiggled underlining, light- and dark-mode (because we can), FiraCode font (look at that thread-first!), fifty shades of grey. Never would we expect Clojurians to look into the bleak window of a plain editor, instead our Perseus shield of Clay will prevent him from turning into stone. In this way, the existing Clay examples themselves will become little stones in the powers users' mosaic their of own videos that flash out their IDEs and Clojure's superpowers. SciKloj should leave that open space, generously leave the fun of presenting an IDE to acquaintances from the wider Clojure community.

That said, SciKloj best uses the REPL in its plain form: the prompt. It has been neglected up to now. The prompt is well known to Python users and has nothing to do with an IDE.

The REPL is awesome and awful both at the same time. This is because when using the REPL, what is on disk is not what is in memory. The equation "disk=memory", the cornerstone of the Figwheel-reload approach, does not hold anymore. In other words: one can make a complete mess.

But that is ok, because one can use the REPL also to great advantage. And to show both the awesome and awful aspects of the REPL, it can make sense to use the REPL prompt to override the behaviour of the above described double-comma. This double-comma, which was described as a means for printline debugging, should be seen as an earmark and be allowed to change its behaviour.

This is the concept of earmarking some part of the code as "special", so that only this part of the code is evaluated when the full source file is read and processed. I call this the "rich-comment comprehension", which is a great invention.

The astute reader will now undoubtedly say: Hang on a minute! Not long ago you were condemning this "earmarking of code as special". You were calling it a fallacy. You were calling it the "triple-comma fallacy". Now you are praising this same "earmarking of code as special". You call it comprehension, the "rich-comment comprehension". Just renaming things does not make them better. Thus your argument is not understandable.

The all important difference between the "rich-comment comprehension" and the "triple-comma fallacy" is that the latter fallacy is committed in the Figwheel-reload mindset. Technically, the two concepts "rich-comment" and "triple-comma" are one an the same, the two names denote the same technical fact. But the "triple-comma" fallacy is committed by mentally working within the Figwheel-reload tradition. The lapse is the following: not to leave the Figwheel-reload tradition before using "rich-comment comprehension", thereby committing the "triple-comma fallacy".

Naive users will find the "triple-comma" fallacy convenient, make a mess and blame Clojure the language for that. And the Clojure community will rightly blame the SciKloj boffins for befouling Clojure by giving naive users the possibility to make a mess in Clojure.

In order to activate the "rich-comment comprehension", a user must be able to open the REPL prompt, thereby acknowledging to leave the file-based Figwheel-reload tradition and enter the namespace-based REPL tradition. He demonstrates that he is not a naive user anymore. He knows and shows - by typing at the REPL prompt - that the equation "disk=memory" does not hold anymore and is willing to take full responsibility. When making a mess, which he undoubtedly will, he cannot blame Clojure the language but has to admit that he has been using the REPL in a wrong way. And that not only is perfectly ok amongst Clojurians, but indeed messing with the REPL is the way to actually become a Clojurian.

## Afterword
This concludes my essay Ã  clef. I had to invent SciKloj because SciCloj proper is so multifaceted that it is next to impossible to talk about SciCloj. I am of the opinion that from the ideas presented for SciKloj, as many as possible should become part of the real SciCloj.
