Physics has three important postulates:

(1) The speed of light is invariant  
(2) Quantum randomness is pure  
(3) Quantum states live outside 3d-space  

My opinion is that, however a new theory might look like, the above three will remain as they are accepted now. So says my magic looking glass.

Those postulates are based on empirical evidence in the laboratory. Especially in randomness postulate (2), a.k.a. the Born-rule, the "pure" assumption is based on the painstaking exclusion of many conceivable alternatives.

Out of those postulates follows the theorem that there is no signal faster than light. No tachyons allowed. This is because from the constant-speed postulate (1) it follows that tachyons can be used to send data into the past. And sending into the past violates the "pure" in postulate (2).

At least that is how I interpret "pure" in randomness: without possible past explanation, in principle unpredictable, in no case exists a beforehand explanation within the state of the universe.

The constant-speed postulate (1) was accepted by 1920. The randomness postulate (2) took form after 1930. Did people in the 1920th think that tachyon signalling faster than light was possible? I guess not. Why? Because they chose to believe in free will. Only with pure determinism there are no contradictions arising from the possibility to send signals into the past. Anything better than determinism in the roaring 20s, certainly the impossibility of faster than light phoning was acceptable.

Einstein did not believe in free will. But because of his insistence on locality, he did not believe in supraluminal signalling either. In 1916 he introduced random spontaneous emission. I make the preposterous claim that Einstein introduced the dice in physics to save locality.

To explain non-local entanglement, postulate (3) is necessary. Exactly because it proposes an entity that lives outside 3d-space, this postulate cannot be tested directly in the laboratory. Einstein did not like this spooky stuff, but to this day no alternative to postulate (3) has been found to explain laboratory-observed entanglement.

Now I'd like to make a move Einstein would not have liked either: add free-will to the postulate mix and remove the original meaning of "pure". Because if we decide to not only allow laboratory reports but also allow as evidence the consistent reports about inner states of human beings, we very well can postulate fundamental free will.

The assumption of a free will for certain states attached to human beings is based on painstaking exclusions of many conceivable alternatives. The additional assumption of "fundamental", i.e. that will-carrying states live outside of 3d-space (and thus humans), is a daring  extension of spooky postulate (3).

However, the postulate of fundamental free-will can be used to explain the "pure" behaviour of observed randomness. The painstaking search for alternatives to the "pure" in postulate (2) can in this light be seen as a fundamental search of free will to find itself.

So, I do not know if I have free will. Nor do I worship free will. I am well aware that Hegel saw the villain Napoleon as personified Weltgeist. But I want an explanation for Child-Mozart's autograph score. Or deBroglie's search for his wave-length.
