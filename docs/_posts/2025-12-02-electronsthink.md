## Preamble
Transcript of a talk by Erwin Schrödinger for the BBC in 1949 ([link to manuscript](https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:168238)).

He is opposed to locating free will within the laws of quantum mechanics. Full disclosure: I am not opposed.

Quote:
> free use of the “choice” ... would infringe the statistical laws.

Schrödinger has a notion of "free" as in: all singing and dancing and anything goes. But there is another definition of "free" will. It is Immanuel Kant's "act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." Car drivers have free will. Accidents happen, but on the whole they act statistically out of free reasoning. Good compromise stemming from free will. What puzzles me is that Schrödinger certainly knew Kant well and could have brought this argument by himself.

I take the liberty to mention that Schrödinger was wrong in the following:
> let me observe that physics strictly disallows a mutual dependence of the "choices" taken by various electrons unless they are close neighbours.

The "unless they are close neighbours" is the expression of locality in physics. Locality is not assumed in 21st century physics anymore. It is commonly assumed that in their insistence on locality, Schrödinger and Einstein erred.

> there might be a delicate system of relay action which we may have hitherto failed to discover.

Why failed to discover? Schrödinger himself discovered this "relay action". That is because he correctly insisted, from the outset, on his wave-function living in high dimensional configuration space. Consequently, he even coined the notion of "entanglement" as _the_ new trait of Quantum Mechanics. But he obviously did not believe in the full stretch of that relay action deeply rooted in his wave mechanics. In the 21st century, after lots of experiments, we definitely do believe in correlations over miles of distances.

## Do electrons think?

Electrons are charged
particles, the minutest we find in
analyzing the ultimate constitution of
matter. To think that such a particle can
think is so
absurd, that I might give the answer no
and have my talk
over. However the idea has been launched
not very long ago
not of course in this patently absurd
form but under a
disguise. Of late it has off and on met
with quite honorable
reception. Some intellectual hope has
been set on
it. I wish to plead here for the futility
of this
hope. To explain matters I must go far
back.

There is a very old dilemma in
natural
philosophy: are our bodies and the bodies
of the animals
machines that act of necessity, according
to their material
constitution and under the material
influence of the environment, including
the Impressions on the sense
organs? This question - are we
automatons? - has about as often been
answered emphatically in the
positive as in the
negative. It would lead us too far to
follow all the arguments that came to
the fore in the long history of the
controversy. Strange compromises were
suggested. Descartes, for instance, deemed us
to be on the whole automatons, only the
pineal gland, he said, was
not. According to Descartes it was this organ
which which controlled and directed all
our spontaneous bodily
movements.

What is the present attitude
of physiology to the
question? We may take for it the word of
its past Master Sir Charles
Sherrington. According to
Sherrington, there is no boundary between
the animate and the
inanimate. The same laws of physics and
physical chemistry hold within the
living body as
outside. The most careful investigation
of the physiological processes, in the
nerves and in the brain, reveals no
leverage whereby mind could take direct
influence on
matter. "Mind, per se (that is by its very
nature) cannot play the piano - mind per se
cannot move a finger of a hand".

This leaves us with the outlook that our
body is as automatic or non-automatic as
any inanimate piece of matter, any
mechanical, chemical, electrical
contrivance, only infinitely more
complicated than even the most ingenious
man-made
machinery. The question is thus referred
from the tribunal of physiology to that
of physics and
chemistry. But in the tribunal - to keep to
the simile for a moment - there sits by
the side of the judges a non-
jurisprudent assessor, namely our own
little self which finds it distasteful
to pass for an
automaton.

Now what does physics say to
it? The situation is
peculiar. From the earliest beginnings of
physical
science we meet with a firm conviction,
that everything that happens is governed
by inviable laws, so that the course of
events forms an inevitable and
unalterable infinite sequence of causes
and
effects. The first atomic physicist was
Leucippus, a contemporary of Socrates in the
5th Century
B.C. Of Leucippus only two sayings are
preserved, One that he refused to believe
that sun, moon and the stars are living
beings, and the other, which concerns us
here, is that nothing comes to pass
without a cause, but everything happens
by reason and of
necessity. This he maintained in the 5th
century B.C. And towards the end of the
19th Century A.D. physicists were fully
prepared to endorse his
opinion.

But now comes the peculiar
thing. Twice within 2 and a half thousand
years there was a notable departure from
the belief in the strict necessity of
physical
events. The first time this happened only
about 150 years after Leucippus.
We gather this from the didactic poem of
Lucretius, who was the posthumus mouth-piece
of
Epicurus, who lived in the 4th century
B.C. Their suggestion had no consequences
it was all but
forgotten. The second time the strictly
causal linkage in the chain of physical
happenings was thrown into doubt
was only 30 years ago by Franz Exner in
Vienna. About 10 years later, that is
about 20 years ago from
today, the disbelief in strict cation
became part and parcel of what you might
call the New Creed now adopted by most
physicists and called Quantum Mechanics.

Both times, the alleged breakdown of
strict causality in the domain of physics
was hailed for removing the obstacle in
our understanding the spontaneity of the
movements of the animals and of
man - in understanding free will, as one
usually calls
it. Let us see whether this claim is
justified.

The hypothesis, as reported by
Lucretius,
was very simple
indeed. He just states that the atoms do
swerve in a very small but entirely
undetermined and unforeseeable way from
the courses you would expect them to
take from supposed strict physical
laws. No theory of the swerves is
offered. This amounts to saying that the
strict laws are only figments.
The actual path of a particle is to a
small extent arbitrary in the
neighborhood of the fictitiously
prescribed
path. It is not illogical to surmise that
the several little arbitrarinesses of the
single atoms collaborate to bring about
the apparent arbitrariness in the
behavior of the animals and of man.

What Lucretius forgets is that he has
explained nothing, he has solved no
problem. He has only referred the problem
back to the ultimate particles, where it
has become much more difficult to
grapple
with. The simplest spontaneous bodily
movement, say the lifting of my arm, would
require the planned collaboration of
billions of single atoms in their
undetermined swerves, if **they** should
bring about the integrated
action.

In modern physics the denial of
strict causation is of entirely different
nature, in two
respects. First there is no question of
only *small* departures from a fictitious
exact law of
motion. The behavior of primal particles,
as electrons for instance, or of small
atomic systems composed of only a
few of
them, is now supposed to be undetermined
and
unforeseeable within a wide margin of
uncertainty. It is thought that in times
we have to allow a particle the choice
between several entirely different
courses to
take. Let this for the moment be
figurative speech, meaning only that
nothing in the observed situation
determines the course the particle actually
takes.

But on the other hand the
situation is supposed to determine with
rigorous precision the statistics of the
various possible
"choices". Given the same situation over
and over again, the particle will, for
instance, in exactly 2/3 of the cases
follow one course, in 1/3 of the
cases the other;
and similarly when there are more than
two courses to
follow.

Again, the same as 2,000 years ago,
it has been
suggested that this breach of strict
cation leaves room for the display of
the spontaneous movements in the animals
and in
man. Is *this* claim now
justified? I think not.
There are grave objections from physics,
from physiology and from
philosophy.

From
physics: if the individual or its mind or
whatnot could make free use of the
"choice" left to the single
electrons this would infringe the
statistical laws when a synoptic view of
many similar cases is
taken. This is as bad or as good as a
breach of strictly causal
laws. If we suspend physics in the living
body we can explain
anything. I put this point briefly and
drastically. It could be clinched in all
detail.

To explain the physiological
objection,
let me observe that physics strictly
disallows a mutual dependence of the
"choices" taken by various electrons
unless they are close
neighbours. One would therefore have to
assume - and this has been proposed - a
master cell and within it a master
molecule. And here the choice on the
atomic scale would take place and would
determine a spontaneous movement of the
whole
body. This is flatly contradicted by what
we know about the functioning of the
brain. The number of brain cells
cooperating in such a case is enormous
and the idea that they should always be
set at work by one master cell - even if
it were not to be always the same one - is
ludicrous.

But assume you could override
even this objection -
there might be a delicate system of
relay action which we may have hitherto
failed to
discover. Then I am left to believe that
a single electron or very few of them, by
making use of the free "choice" the
primitive laws of physics leave them,
should enact a movement of my body.
However this movement is sometimes
preceded by a long deliberation, a
careful and maybe painful weighing of
motives. This ultimately
disposes, let me say, my mouth to open and
to pronounce the name of a person I
hesitated to give
away.

It is not only obvious but actually
indubitable that the preliminary
deliberations involve extended parts of
the brain, billions and billions of
cells. To assume that this activity
eventually **determines** the decision in
the supposed master-group of electrons
would entirely spoil the
game; for the point was that their
behavior was to be exempt from physical
causation. If you want to keep this up, you
needs must be prepared to let let all
the thinking and weighing of motivs be
done by the one master-group of
electrons alone and without any
accompanying physical
process. This is absurd.
