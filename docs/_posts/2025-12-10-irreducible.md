In the following some quotes from Federico Faggin's "irreducible":

> Any new meaning must first occur within our consciousness and then it can be communicated by creating new symbols, just as it happens for a book whose content can only be written after the author has comprehended what he will symbolically express.

The best example is Shakespeare who basically had to invent the English language for expressing himself.

The notion of authorship and the belief in the act of creation contradicts the possibility for sending signals into the past. If I were able to send my copy of Hamlet into the past, no one would have written Hamlet. Who would have comprehended its meaning? Certainly not me. Comprehension gives time its arrow.

With the additional assumption that the the speed of light is invariant, the ban to send signals into the past is equivalent to banning signals faster than the speed of light. This guarantees locality. And this generates my understanding of space.

Shakespeare created a

> symbol that never existed before, in which case an external observer could not have assigned a probability prior to measuring it.

Shakespeare created words that no reader could ever have expected. No reader could ever "assign a probability" prior to reading the word "fashionable". The word "fashionable" could not have been probed before because it hadn't existed before. This word was not probe - able.

There are Bayesianists who say that one can "just reserve some amount of probability for the totally unexpected". With Popper, I insist that one cannot assign a probability to the appearance of a new theory that replaces, say, Thermodynamics. Probabilities can be assigned only after the set of all possible events is stated. Before being able to assign probabilities, all possible events have to have in common some property, some meaning, which can be expressed as a number. The hight of a person is an example of such a number which captures one and the same property pertaining to any human being.

> unitarity is equivalent to eliminating creativity and free will from the universe, since a creative state, prior to its creation for the first time, cannot even be known by its creator.

I like the idea of

> a more general quantum theory ... that ... allows the existence of irreversible non-unitary transformations.

Concerning standard Quantum Mechanics:

> The probabilistic physical laws describing the behaviour of the states of the quantum fields [are] statistical laws similar to those of the letters of the alphabet of our languages.

So, most of the time quantum states behave in a tame "unitary" way. Just like in most books the letter e appears 150 times more often than the letter z. But there should be, and that is Faggin's prediction, "non-unitary" exceptions. I am not sure whether this is the same as [Zeilinger says](https://youtu.be/O2sHn0bOC5I?t=3055): "Objective chance is a possibility which God sometimes maybe uses to act incognito" "God acts in a way which is not scientifically detectable" "It is a matter of faith, this is my personal opinion".
