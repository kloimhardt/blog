"It was so painful at the Euro, but maybe if we had won it we would not have won the World Cup."

"We did not play a huge game but we showed mental quality. And we scored four goals anyway. They deserved to win. The group worked so hard and we had some tough moments along the way. It hurt so much to lose the Euro two years ago, but it made us learn too."

“For us, we are not the favorites,” Pogba continued. “We stay as we are from the start of the tournament. We have no doubts. We play together. That's our strength. We are chasing something and will do everything to succeed."

“We are conscious of the situation. We do not want to make the same mistakes like two years ago. We want to work for it, to give everything we have to take this cup home," the midfielder said this week. “I think at the Euro we thought it was already a done deal. The mentality was not the same as now. I cannot lie that when we beat Germany [in the Euro semi] we thought that was the final. I know the taste of losing a final. I don't want it to happen again."
